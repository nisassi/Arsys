\# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS

\# BOTH MAIN\_AGENT AND TESTING\_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK



\# Communication Protocol:

\# If the `testing\_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.

\#

\# You have access to a file called `test\_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state

\# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.

\#

\# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 

\# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

\# 

\## user\_problem\_statement: {problem\_statement}

\## backend:

\##   - task: "Task name"

\##     implemented: true

\##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

\##     file: "file\_path.py"

\##     stuck\_count: 0

\##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

\##     needs\_retesting: false

\##     status\_history:

\##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

\##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

\##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

\##

\## frontend:

\##   - task: "Task name"

\##     implemented: true

\##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

\##     file: "file\_path.js"

\##     stuck\_count: 0

\##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

\##     needs\_retesting: false

\##     status\_history:

\##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

\##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

\##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

\##

\## metadata:

\##   created\_by: "main\_agent"

\##   version: "1.0"

\##   test\_sequence: 0

\##   run\_ui: false

\##

\## test\_plan:

\##   current\_focus:

\##     - "Task name 1"

\##     - "Task name 2"

\##   stuck\_tasks:

\##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

\##   test\_all: false

\##   test\_priority: "high\_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck\_first"

\##

\## agent\_communication:

\##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

\##     -message: "Communication message between agents"



\# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent

\#

\# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:

\#    - Main agent must always update the `test\_result.md` file before calling the testing agent

\#    - Add implementation details to the status\_history

\#    - Set `needs\_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing

\#    - Update the `test\_plan` section to guide testing priorities

\#    - Add a message to `agent\_communication` explaining what you've done

\#

\# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:

\#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status\_history

\#    - Update the working status based on user feedback

\#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck\_count

\#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task\_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status\_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 

\#

\# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:

\#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck\_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task\_result.md

\#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions

\#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck\_tasks list

\#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck\_count until the testing agent confirms it's working

\#

\# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:

\#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:

\#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test\_plan)

\#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed

\#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on

\#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify

\#

\# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test\_result.md

\#

\# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test\_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.
